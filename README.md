# GDG DevFest Elm Workshop 2016
## Josh Adams | [DailyDrip](http://www.dailydrip.com)

This is the repository for [my workshop on Elm at GDG DevFest
2016](https://gdgcapitalregion.bitbucket.io/schedule/day1?sessionId=118).

We'll assume you have Elm installed, and walk through building a basic
application in Elm and then using the
[elm-mdl](https://debois.github.io/elm-mdl/) package to make really nice looking
sites in [the Material Design style](https://material.io/), quickly and easily
and without bugs.

## Preparation

If you are going to be involved in the workshop, please try to have the
following set up ahead of time.

- [Install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html#install)
  - [Mac installer](http://install.elm-lang.org/Elm-Platform-0.17.1.pkg)
  - [Windows installer](http://install.elm-lang.org/Elm-Platform-0.17.1.exe)
  - Linux or anything else:
    - `npm install -g elm` should get you set up
- You could also have a look at [my video that walks you through installation and
  some basics in the REPL](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elm/drips/introduction-and-installing).
- If you really want to be prepared, you could check out [my video on building
  your first Elm HTML Application](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elm/drips/our-first-html-application).
